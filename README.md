# 3DRacingGameUnity

This is a 3D racing game that allows players to drive on a circuit around a scenic mountain terrain. The terrain has been imported through the unity asset store, and then trees have been added manually to provide a more interesting driving experience. For realism, wind component has been added to several parts of the terrain so the trees aren't just static. 

Cinemachine has been used to provide a camera that can be hooked onto the car's body and follow it as the player drivers around from a third person view. Below is a screenshot of the terrain being used for this project:
